# ðŸ›¶ Git Workflow

Teams at Launch Pad will use the git version control system and GitHub website
to build software collaboratively. This document describes a recommended GitHub
workflow for Launch Pad teams, as well as a basic intro on how to execute that
workflow yourself.

## Updating Your Copy of the Codebase

Most projects will have a primary branch, which will usually be called `master`.
Before beginning new development, make sure you have checked out your project's
`master` branch and have the most recent commits from your GitHub repo on your
local `master` branch by:

```
git checkout master
git pull
```

## Branches

When you begin working on a feature or bug fix associated with a GitHub issue,
create a new branch from `master`; the most convenient way to do this is:

```
git checkout -b <my-new-branch>
```

Branch naming varies from team to team - one format is to name it with the
following template:

```
<name>/#<issue-number>-<issue-description>
```

For instance, if Eric is working on issue #23, which is for adding a like
button, he would name his branch `eric/#23-like-button`.

Alternatively, a larger project can name branches based on the component being
affected, like so:

```
<component>/#<issue-number>-<issue-description>
```

For example, if you're adding a like button to the user profile page, you would
name your branch `profile/#23-like-button`.

If you have been working on your branch for a while, there may have been updates
to your project's `master` branch that you want to include in your branch. To
update your branch, run the following command:

```
git pull origin master
```

Alternatively, you can rebase ("replay" your commits on top of the latest
`master` commit) instead by running `git pull --rebase origin master` instead.

## Developing and Committing Code

All new code should be committed to the new issue branch. To make commits, first
you must "stage" your new code:

```
git add .
```

This will add all edited files in your project to "staging", which means it will
be part of your next commit. You can add individual files as well using
`git add <my-file-name>`. When you have finalized your change, you should commit
it using the following command:

```
git commit -m "<my-description>"
```

Commits on the remote issue branch should contain logical chunks of functionality
and be accompanied by descriptive commit messages. A commit description should
be a brief, succinct, and accurate overview of your changes - messages like
"fix" or "attempt 12" are uninformative and unhelpful, while "Added check to
account for edge case in render()" is a good message. You can refer to
[this guide](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules) for an
overview of how to write good commit messages.

When you're happy with a chunk of functionality, which is usually be built
over several commits, you should push it to a remote (i.e. GitHub) branch. The
easiest way to do this is to run the following command:

```
git push origin HEAD
```

Commits can be edited if you feel your commits are not descriptive enough - if
you would like some help doing so, ask your Tech Lead.

## Pull Request

When the issue being worked on is ready to be merged into `master` and all
relevant commits on that branch have been pushed to GitHub, OR when you feel
like you are stuck and need help, create a pull request on GitHub. Opening
work-in-progress pull requests for your branch is a good way to get feedback on
your direction and get pointers on how to best complete your task.

* Request a review from anyone who is familiar with the section of the codebase
  being worked on; it is often a good idea to request a review from your Tech Lead
  as well.
* **At least** one other team member must review every pull request before it is
  merged (your team should be enforcing this with GitHub's repository controls).
* If a reviewer requests changes, update the PR accordingly and request another
  review.
* Once the reviewer accepts the changes, merge the PR.
* Once it is merged, delete the branch.
