## Writing Code

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is an open-source,
  lightweight code editor with a large ecosystem of extensions that provides
  integrations with almost every language under the sun. It's a great place to
  start if you are unsure!
* [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client) is a slick interface on top
  of git that helps you visualize your commit graph and execute git commands
  through an intuitive desktop application.

## Browser Plugins

* The [Sourcegraph browser extension](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/browser_extension)
  offers IDE-like features such as documentation when you hover over code on
  GitHub - super useful for reading code and making code reviews.
