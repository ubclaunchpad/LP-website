# Resources

This page provides a bevy of good self-learning resources for every topic, accessible for anyone (not just Launch Pad members)! Looking for Launch Pad-specific documentation? Head on over to [the Handbook](../handbook/)!

If you want further pointers, get in touch with your tech lead - they can direct you to more resources or to another Launch Pad member that knows more. And if you want to add even more resources, feel free to [make a pull request](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## üöÄ Project Groundwork

These pages contain resources to help you kickstart your project!

* [Choosing a Stack](/resources/groundwork/stack-choosing.md)
* [Web Groundwork](/resources/groundwork/web.md)
* [Android Groundwork](/resources/groundwork/android.md)
* [iOS Groundwork](/resources/groundwork/iOS.md)

## üõ∂ Git Workflow

A recommended git/GitHub collaborative development workflow is introduced in
[Git Workflow](git-workflow.md).

## üí¨ Programming Languages

Looking for resources to a specific programming language? Drop by the
[Programming Languages](./languages.md) page!

## ‚öíÔ∏è Tools

Boost your productivity and learn about the tools we use at Launch Pad over in
the [Tools](tools.md) page!

## üêπ Deployment

Want to make your project available to the world? Head on over to our
[Deployment](./deployment.md) section!

## üë®‚Äçüíº Repo Management

* [Shields.io](https://shields.io/#/) provides a frankly massive number of
  badges that you can put in your repo's README to show off your Travis builds,
  website, license, issue tracking, and lots of other stuff!
* [Pull Reminders](https://pullreminders.com) is a service that notifies you
  over Slack of pull-request-related activity on your repos, and also has
  lots of useful dashboards showing stats on review turnaround time, number
  of reviews, and so on. Pull Reminders is already set up with Launch Pad's
  repos, and we highly recommend enabling reminders!
* Our Handbook also has a section about managing repositories: [Repository Management](../handbook/project-management/repositories).

## üíª Command Line

* Matt Might has a pair of Unix tutorials, one for
  [total beginners](http://matt.might.net/articles/basic-unix/) and one for
  [advanced beginners](http://matt.might.net/articles/settling-into-unix/),
  which are like the missing user's guide for the command line.
* Remy Sharp has a
  [list of command line tools](https://remysharp.com/2018/08/23/cli-improved)
  better than their built-in counterparts.
* Included in that list but also worth mentioning separately,
  [tldr pages](https://tldr.sh) is a project to build short-and-sweet guides to
  common use cases.
* If you're using bash, the
  [bash-completion](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion) project provides a
  huge number of tab-completion scripts for common command line programs.
* git also has
  [autocomplete](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Basics-Tips-and-Tricks)
  scripts available - these will save you literally hours of your life.

## üé® Front End Development

* Grab, an Uber competitor in South East Asia, has a great big
  [guide to front end development](https://github.com/grab/front-end-guide/blob/master/README.md),
  which covers everything from React to hosting and deployment.

### Vue

* The official UBC Launch Pad website is written in Vue and TypeScript, and the repository
  includes [introductory documentation on working with Vue and TypeScript](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/ubclaunchpad.com/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#development)

## üìù Cheatsheets

* [devhints.io](https://devhints.io) provides cheat sheets for a huge number of
  web development and sysadmin/ops-related tools and programs.
* [cheat.sh](https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh) is a service along the lines
  of the above, but it can also be run from the command line.
* If you want to learn vim, or just use a vim mode in the editor or IDE of your
  choice, you can't go wrong with this [vim cheat sheet](https://vim.rtorr.com).

## üß™ Coding Challenges

* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) is probably the most popular website for coding
  challenges and comes highly recommended for interview preparation - big companies
  often take interview questions directly from LeetCode!
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) is a similar coding challenge site,
  which many companies use directly for interview screening.
* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a very different style of coding
  challenge site - it has a much sparser presentation than rivals like LeetCode
  and HackerRank, and generally focuses on (sometimes rather esoteric) mathematical
  conundrums. But for the mathematically-inclined programmer, it can be a rich
  resource for delightful insights. Also, our very own ML Tech Lead Kevin built
  a [command line tool](https://github.com/iKevinY/EulerPy) to make it easier
  to work on Project Euler problems in Python!

## üóÇÔ∏è Windows

Having trouble with Windows? Check out [our Windows guidance](./Windows.md)!

## üí≠ General Learning

* Launch Pad has its very own
  [Medium](https://medium.com/ubc-launch-pad-software-engineering-blog)
  publication! Talk to one of the co-presidents if you're interested in being
  published and becoming famous.
* The consulting firm Thoughtbot recently made their
  [Upcase learning platform](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase) free for everyone.
  It has a lot of short video lectures on a variety of topics, especially
  Ruby and Vim, which can be quite useful for new developers.
* [every-programmer-should-know](https://github.com/mtdvio/every-programmer-should-know)
  provides a collection of technical things every software developer should
  know.
* [Slides](https://slides.ubclaunchpad.com/) contains slideshow decks for most
  UBC Launch Pad presentations and workshops, both internal and external.

## üßó Exploration

The [Exploration](./exploration.md) section has Tech Lead-approved resources for
those that want to explore more complicated topics like operating systems,
programming languages, and machine learning.
