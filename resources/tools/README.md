# Tools & Technologies

This page covers some general recommended tools to help you get started with
building awesome things, as well as some of the tech we use within Launch Pad
for development and communication.

## General Tools

### Writing Code

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is an open-source,
  lightweight code editor with a large ecosystem of extensions that provides
  integrations with almost every language under the sun. It's a great place to
  start if you are unsure!
* [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client) is a slick interface on top
  of git that helps you visualize your commit graph and execute git commands
  through an intuitive desktop application.

### Browser Plugins

* The [Sourcegraph browser extension](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/browser_extension)
  offers IDE-like features such as documentation when you hover over code on
  GitHub - super useful for reading code and making code reviews.

## Tech @ Launch Pad

### Slack

See the [Slack page](./slack.md) to learn more about our Slack workspace!

### GitHub

We use GitHub to host, document, and manage the code in all our projects.

Launch Pad-wide documentation is hosted in this repository - if you're not sure
about something, this is the first place to check. Each project has an
associated GitHub repository, and documentation for the project lives in that
repository, either as version-controlled files (preferably in Markdown format
like these) or in the wiki.

Projects are typically managed with
[GitHub project boards](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/)
as well.
