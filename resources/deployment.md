## Inertia

Several Launch Pad projects in the past have utilized our in-house deployment
tool, [Inertia](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/inertia), to kickstart their
projects.

A comprehensive usage guide is available in the [Inertia documentation](https://inertia.ubclaunchpad.com/).
A good place to start might be to look into leveraging
[Inertia's AWS integration](https://inertia.ubclaunchpad.com/#provisioning-a-remote)
that lets you easily provision a remote for deployment.
