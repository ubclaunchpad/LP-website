## Tips and Tricks

### Search from anywhere

You can add this website as a custom search engine in many browsers (for example, [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95426)) and tools like [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/web-search/#custom)! Just set the following fields:

- Search Engine: `Launch Pad`
- Keyword: `lp`
- URL: `https://docs.ubclaunchpad.com/search?query=%s`

Search is also available from the navigation bar on most pages. If you find the navigation bar search a bit cramped, you can also try out the [dedicated search page](/search.md).

### Dark mode

Hit the gear icon in the navigation bar to toggle dark mode!
