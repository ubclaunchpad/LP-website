# ðŸš€ Onboarding for Everyone

Welcome to UBC Launch Pad! This page takes you through some important items you need to get started ðŸ’ª

## Checklist

::: tip
If you don't have access to anything, or if you can't complete any of these steps for whatever reason, or if you have any questions, drop a message in [`#ask-leads`](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com/messages/CK935RD3Q/)!
:::

### Discord

Make sure you are part of the [UBC Launch Pad Discord server](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com/).

- Make sure you install the Discord app on your phone and laptop so you don't miss anything!
- Read our [Discord](../tools/discord.md) guide, which will tell you how to make the most of Discord, how to find and meet people, and any noteworthy channels you should check out!
  - Don't forget to add your full name and a photo of yourself to your Slack profile to help everyone get to know you!

### Rocket Setup

Rocket is our Discord bot and team management tool - make sure you help Rocket get to know you! Once you join the Discord server, Rocket will have DMed you with steps to get verified. If, for some reason, your Discord privacy settings disallowed it, you can message Rocket and type the following:

```
/verifyvoyager
```

Then, Rocket will follow up with steps to verify your member status. For more information check out our [Rocket Guide](../tools/rocket.md).

### GitHub Access

Make sure you are part of the [UBC Launch Pad GitHub organization](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/).

- You should be able to access our private repositories, such as [`ubclaunchpad/ideas`](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/ideas)
  - If you can't see the Ideas repository, check that you are in the GitHub team [`@ubclaunchpad/all`](https://github.com/orgs/ubclaunchpad/teams/all) - if not, make sure you've [set up your profile on Rocket](#rocket-setup)!
- Read our [Intro to GitHub](../tools/github.md) guide, which will help you get started on leveraging GitHub and setting up notifications.
  - Make sure you read the section on notifications for Slack - GitHub will be the primary way to manage tasks and have structured discussions, so you don't want to miss any updates!

### Drive Access

Make sure you have access to our [Projects Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/18piFDBdAUuZAOf9xOgpf2_HBUuVNae0S) on Google Drive - this is where your team's loose documents will live. [Rocket](#rocket-setup) should do this for you - check your email for an invitation! Please do not ask to be added directly without checking with `#ask-rocket` if there is a problem.

## Further Actions

If you've got everything set up, congratulations - you are pretty much good to go! Make sure you take some time to get to know this website - it should contain everything you need to know to kickstart your time with Launch Pad, and if anything is missing please [let us know](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/docs/issues/new)!

- [Handbook](../README.md)
- [Resources](../../resources/README.md)

For some of you, there are additional things you should be aware of:

- [for Design](./design.md)
- [for Strategy](./strategy.md)
- [for Leads](./leads.md)

When project teams are formed, make sure your tech lead adds you to the appropriate [Rocket](/handbook/tools/slack#rocket) team!
