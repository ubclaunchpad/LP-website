# ✉️ Email

Our currently active accounts:

- `team@ubclaunchpad.com` - access granted to Launch Pad presidents only.
- `strategy@ubclaunchpad.com` - access granted to [strategy members](/handbook/onboarding/strategy.md#email). All mail is forwarded to `team@ubclaunchpad.com` as well for visibility.

Credentials are available in the [`ubclaunchpad/exec`](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/exec) repository. Both accounts are managed by the `team@ubclaunchpad.com` GSuite account.

When using a `ubclaunchpad.com` email, you are representing the club as a whole, not yourself. With that in mind, we have the following policies:

- **All third-party accounts** should be tied to `team@ubclaunchpad.com`, and not any other account. This gives us the ability to recover lost accounts and track active accounts we have.
- **Do not create new GSuite users** - each user increases our cost, while making it difficult to track down where things are and hand off assets appropriately.
- **Do not create new email aliases** - similar to users, aliases increases confusion when dealing with users. _Definitely_ do not create aliases for yourself, such as `mygreatname@ubclaunchpad.com`.

To aid in organization, you can create [filters](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579?hl=en) that apply labels to incoming emails.

## Troubleshooting

### Suspicious sign-in

Since email accounts are shared, Google frequently suspects that we are hackers. To bypass a suspicious sign-in block, ask one of the presidents to disable login challenges temporarily. To do this:

1. Log in to the [GSuite admin console](https://admin.google.com)
2. Go to Users and select the relevant user
3. Go to Security and click "Login challenge" to temporarily disable it
