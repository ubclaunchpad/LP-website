### Launch Pad

- "Launch Pad", not "Launchpad" or "LaunchPad".
  - In most cases, prefix the name with "UBC" as well, i.e. "UBC Launch Pad"
- `ubclaunchpad` for account names, not `ubc_launch_pad`, `launchpad`, or similar

- Roles: "co-president", "design lead", "tech lead", "developer", "designer", "strategy", etc. - not "Developer" or "Designer".
  - At starts of sentences, use "Co-presidents", "tech lead", etc.
  - In titles, use "Co-President", "Tech Lead", etc.
- Teams: "the Leadership team", "the Design team", "the Strategy team", etc. - not "the design team" or "the strategy team".
