# Teams

Teams and projects are paired one-to-one. All teams include at least one lead with a number of developers and designers. Teams vary in size and developer/designer ratio.

**Depending on the project teams can vary in the following ways:**

---

#### Size

Team size can be larger if project scope is more demanding. As an estimate the average team sizes are 6-8

#### Roles

Teams will by default include 1 or preferreably 2 designers and rest as developers.

- If the project is exclusively a developer project it will not include any designers
- If the project is exclusively a designer project it will not include any developers

#### Experience Levels

Teams will include a balanced ratio of expereince and beginner members. This helps us to ensure projects can reach their goals while having room to grow, learn and mentor. Some teams might have a slighly different breakdown depending on the project

- If the project is demanding, more expereinced members are chosen
- if the project is tailored to offer valuable experiences, more begnner members are choses
