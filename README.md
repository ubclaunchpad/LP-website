## Getting Started

### Tech Stack

- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting and formatting.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. However, not limited to it.
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) for package management.
- This project uses `next/font` to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font, for the best performance.

### Installation

First, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
To check if you have Node.js installed, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
```

If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

Next, make sure you have [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) installed on your machine.
To check if you have PNPM installed, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pnpm -v
```

If you don't have PNPM installed, you can follow the instructions [here](https://pnpm.io/installation).

Now, we can install the project dependencies.

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Running the Project

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
