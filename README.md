Welcome to the Launch Pad docs hub.

We store a great deal of documents that encompasses our club information, good resources and our handbook. This ensures that Launch Pad will have its autonomy as a team club.

We want members have an easy way to view all these docs while ensuring our access scopes are in place and team can also have their own private docs. That's why we've built this wiki tool.
