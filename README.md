# UBC Launch Pad Docs

Welcome to the Launch Pad docs hub. At Launch Pad we a numerous places with different scopes of access where we include relative and practical information for our members.

We've built this hub that brings all the docs together in one app. The hub is built on our internal authentication system that tailors your experience based on access scopes

We don't directly store any posts in this repository; this is a server-side rendered solution to streamline how we share and build on our knowledge as a club
