# Resources

This page provides a bevy of good self-learning resources for the platforms
and langauges we use at Launch Pad. If you want further pointers, get in
touch with your tech lead - they can direct you to more resources or to
another Launch Pad member that knows more. And if you want to add even more
resources, feel free to [make a pull request](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Python

* Check out some of the
  [projects at Launch Pad](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad?language=python)
  that use Python!
* [The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org) is an
  opinionated guide to best-practices Python development, from the creator of
  [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/), one of the most
  popular Python libraries.

## Command Line

* Remy Sharp has a
  [list of command line tools](https://remysharp.com/2018/08/23/cli-improved)
  better than their built-in counterparts.
* Included in that list but also worth mentioning separately,
  [tldr pages](https://tldr.sh) is a project to build short-and-sweet guides to
  common use cases.
* If you're using bash, the
  [bash-completion](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion) project provides a
  huge number of tab-completion scripts for common command line programs.
* git also has
  [autocomplete](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Basics-Tips-and-Tricks)
  scripts available - these will save you literally hours of your life.

## Cheatsheets

* [devhints.io](https://devhints.io) provides cheat sheets for a huge number of
  web development and sysadmin/ops-related tools and programs.
* If you want to learn vim, or just use a vim mode in the editor or IDE of your
  choice, you can't go wrong with this [vim cheat sheet](https://vim.rtorr.com).
