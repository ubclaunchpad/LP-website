# Resources

This page provides a bevy of good self-learning resources for the platforms
and tools we use at Launch Pad. If you want further pointers, get in
touch with your tech lead - they can direct you to more resources or to
another Launch Pad member that knows more. And if you want to add even more
resources, feel free to [make a pull request](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Programming Languages

Looking for resources to a specific programming language? Drop by the
[Languages](Languages.md) page!

## Repo Management

* [Shields.io](https://shields.io/#/) provides a frankly massive number of
  badges that you can put in your repo's README to show off your Travis builds,
  website, license, issue tracking, and lots of other stuff!
* [Pull Reminders](https://pullreminders.com) is a service that notifies you
  over Slack of pull-request-related activity on your repos, and also has
  lots of useful dashboards showing stats on review turnaround time, number
  of reviews, and so on. Pull Reminders is already set up with Launch Pad's
  repos, and we highly recommend enabling reminders!

## Command Line

* Matt Might has a pair of Unix tutorials, one for
  [total beginners](http://matt.might.net/articles/basic-unix/) and one for
  [advanced beginners](http://matt.might.net/articles/settling-into-unix/),
  which are like the missing user's guide for the command line.
* Remy Sharp has a
  [list of command line tools](https://remysharp.com/2018/08/23/cli-improved)
  better than their built-in counterparts.
* Included in that list but also worth mentioning separately,
  [tldr pages](https://tldr.sh) is a project to build short-and-sweet guides to
  common use cases.
* If you're using bash, the
  [bash-completion](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion) project provides a
  huge number of tab-completion scripts for common command line programs.
* git also has
  [autocomplete](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Basics-Tips-and-Tricks)
  scripts available - these will save you literally hours of your life.

## Front End Development

* Grab, an Uber competitor in Southeast Asia, has a great big
  [guide to front end development](https://github.com/grab/front-end-guide/blob/master/README.md),
  which covers everything from React to hosting and deployment.

## Cheatsheets

* [devhints.io](https://devhints.io) provides cheat sheets for a huge number of
  web development and sysadmin/ops-related tools and programs.
* [cheat.sh](https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh) is a service along the lines
  of the above, but it can also be run from the command line.
* If you want to learn vim, or just use a vim mode in the editor or IDE of your
  choice, you can't go wrong with this [vim cheat sheet](https://vim.rtorr.com).

## General Learning

* Launch Pad has its very own
  [Medium](https://medium.com/ubc-launch-pad-software-engineering-blog)
  publication! Talk to one of the co-presidents if you're interested in being
  published and becoming famous.
* The consulting firm Thoughtbot recently made their
  [Upcase learning platform](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase) free for everyone.
  It has a lot of short video lectures on a variety of topics, espcially
  Ruby and Vim, which can be quite useful for new developers.
* [every-programmer-should-know](https://github.com/mtdvio/every-programmer-should-know)
  provides a collection of technical things every software developer should
  know.

## Windows

* Having trouble with Windows? Try [dual booting Linux](x/Windows.md)!
