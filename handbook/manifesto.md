## Vision

> To be the leading university technology organization to ready our members for
industry and entrepreneurship.

UBC Launch Pad is a student team devoted to building software projects in a
collaborative and professional environment.

Our primary objective is to provide the best space at UBC for students to meet
other tech enthusiasts, build projects in a team setting, and practice
professional development tools and principles.

Our secondary objective is to connect with the UBC and Vancouver tech community
by hosting tech-focused events. Examples include interview workshops, tech
talks, and hackathons. We aim to build public interest in tech at UBC and
provide our members with opportunities to develop soft skills like public
speaking and event planning.

If you're interested in hosting a tech talk or have an event idea, post on
Slack or talk to one of the execs!
