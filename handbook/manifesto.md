## Vision <Badge type="tip" text="updated"/>

This section provides guidance on what Launch Pad stands for.

### Our Value Proposition

Technical advancements have created enormous opportunities in the world, people are capable for more than ever before. In this fast changing world, we want to provide a space for students who are passionate about technologies to develop their skills, to explore new possibilities, to share their expertise and learn from others, and to gain hands-on experience in building out what they envision.

Ranking 1st in Computer Science in Canada, UBC has many communities that help to connect students with industry leaders through events, workshops, and Hackathons. However, there is a lack of opportunity for students to apply their knowledge and skills and commit on a project they are passionate about.

Therefore, as a software development club, Launch Pad aims to create the best space for students to learn and practice industry-standard tools and techniques, to develop multidisciplinary teamwork, and to figure out what they can do with technologies.

#### One-liner

As the leading software development club at UBC, Launch Pad prepares students for the future by providing a space for them to learn and practice industry-standard tools through building projects with like-minded individuals.

#### Three-liner

As the leading technology club at UBC,  Launch Pad is devoted to create a collaborative and professional environment for software development. It is our goal to provide the best space for students to apply and develop their technical skills outside of classroom, to learn and practice industry-standard tools, and to build passion projects with like-minded individuals.

### What We Do

Members in Launch Pad form into teams to work on an 8-month development project based on their interests and skill sets. Each team consists of a tech-lead, developers and designers, where they collaboratively go through the design thinking process to design and build a product.

As a club, Launch Pad supports every memberâ€™s experience through multiple ways:

1. We provide enormous resources (Launch Padâ€™s database and guidelines) from experienced members to support members in their development process
2. We connect members with industry professionals to learn about the industry skills through internal workshops
3. We design team structure to enable mentorship and multidisciplinary teamwork from their peers
4. We recruit with high standards to ensure everyone in Launch Pad is driven and dedicated in their own expertise

#### What is Software Engineering?

The phrase is in our club name, but what does it mean? "Software engineering" as a whole is pretty well summed up by this quote from a [blog post by Russ Cox](https://research.swtch.com/vgo-eng), one of the creators of the Go Programming Language:

> Programming means getting a program working. You have a problem to solve, you write some code, you run it, you get your answer, youâ€™re done. Thatâ€™s programming, and that's difficult enough by itself. But what if that code has to keep working, day after day? What if five other programmers need to work on the code too? Then you start to think about version control systems, to track how the code changes over time and to coordinate with the other programmers. You add unit tests, to make sure bugs you fix are not reintroduced over time, not by you six months from now, and not by that new team member whoâ€™s unfamiliar with the code. You think about modularity and design patterns, to divide the program into parts that team members can work on mostly independently. You use tools to help you find bugs earlier. You look for ways to make programs as clear as possible, so that bugs are less likely. You make sure that small changes can be tested quickly, even in large programs. You're doing all of this because your programming has turned into **software engineering**.

### Sponsors and Partners

#### What we offer

* **Talent Pool**: our members are students who went through a rigorous selection process, who are dedicated in advancing their skills, and are experienced in a professional working environment. Many of our past alumni went to top firms and are recognized by industry leaders.
* **Brand/Product Awareness**: our members are always looking for tools to help them make cool things faster and better. They often take these tools into our future workplaces and projects.
* **Innovative Ideas**: our members are problem-solvers across diverse backgrounds.

#### How you can support us

We need long-term support on two fronts:

* **Club Activities**: this includes everything from nice things like occasionally holding internal
events or food to improve team-bonding and productivity, to organizing workshops
and external events that aim to raise awareness about Launch Pad and spread the
expertise that some of our members have acquired. Events both external and internal are expensive, workshops take many hours to
organize and hold, but making sure we do these things on a regular basis is
important for keeping morale up, improving productivity, and draw more people
with an inclination to join Launch Pad to get involved.
* **Services and Resources**: many of our projects rely on servers, tools, and resources that are not free.
We also try to find organization tools, teaching aides, etc. to help run Launch
Pad better. All of this costs money, and the lack of funding means we have to
shut down some cool projects. Continued, long-term investment in Launch Pad
helps us teach our members to use industry-standard tools and practices, as well
as deploying awesome applications.
