## Goals

### Technical Roles

When recruiting for techncial roles, we aim to categorize applicants into the following categories:

* **Beginner**: 1st or 2nd year student OR course project OR simple project (hackathon) OR tutorial project
* **Independent**: Completed 1 internship OR a non-course "advanced project"
  * An advanced project meets the following criteria:
    * long-term (for example, at least 1 month between the first to most recent commit)
    * is non-trivial and the product of tangible effort (up to judgement)
    * demonstrable use programming paradigms (even as simple as loops)
* **Experienced**: (2 internships OR outstanding project) AND nails technical question AND interest in mentorship

To provide support to our less experienced members and ensure a productive environment for everyone, when recruiting we aim to have:

* around 40% of members be "beginners".
* at least 20% of members (including leads) be "experienced".

### Design Roles

When recruiting for design roles, it is important to note that most teams will consist of only 1 designer, sometimes 2. Because of this, experience levels of designers per team may vary. Our definition experience levels are as follows:

* **Beginner**: 1st or 2nd year student OR student from any major/faculty with interest in UX AND 1 simple case study
* **Experienced**: 1-3 comprehensive case studies OR 1 or more UX design internships AND interest in mentorship

Our goal is to recruit a 60-40 ratio with 60% being beginners and 40% being experienced. This is to provide support to beginner designers as well as keeping a efficient and productive environment.

Given these goals, we would require our applicants to have the following:
* At least 1 case study showcasing their design skills.
