## Goals

### Technical Roles

When recruiting for techncial roles, we aim to categorize applicants into the following categories:

* **Beginner**: 1st or 2nd year student OR course project OR simple project (hackathon) OR tutorial project
* **Independent**: Completed 1 internship OR a non-course "advanced project"
  * An advanced project meets the following criteria:
    * long-term (for example, at least 1 month between the first to most recent commit)
    * is non-trivial and the product of tangible effort (up to judgement)
    * demonstrable use programming paradigms (even as simple as loops)
* **Experienced**: (2 internships OR outstanding project) AND nails technical question AND interest in mentorship

To provide support to our less experienced members and ensure a productive environment for everyone, when recruiting we aim to have:

* around 40% of members be "beginners".
* at least 20% of members (including leads) be "experienced".
