# Recruitment Overview

This document provides a overview of why and how we do recruitment at [UBC Launch Pad](https://ubclaunchpad.com).

## Goals

### Technical Roles

When recruiting for techncial roles, we aim to categorize applicants into the following categories:

* **Beginner**: 1st or 2nd year student OR course project OR simple project (hackathon) OR tutorial project
* **Independent**: Completed 1 internship OR a non-course "advanced project"
  * An advanced project meets the following criteria:
    * long-term (for example, at least 1 month between the first to most recent commit)
    * is non-trivial and the product of tangible effort (up to judgement)
    * demonstrable use programming paradigms (even as simple as loops)
* **Experienced**: (2 internships OR outstanding project) AND nails technical question AND interest in mentorship

To provide support to our less experienced members and ensure a productive environment for everyone, when recruiting we aim to have:

* around 40% of members be "beginners".
* at least 20% of members (including leads) be "experienced".

### Design Roles

When recruiting for design roles, it is important to note that most teams will consist of only 1 designer, sometimes 2. Because of this, experience levels of designers per team may vary. Our definition experience levels are as follows:

* **Beginner**: 1st or 2nd year student OR student from any major/faculty with interest in UX AND 1 simple case study
* **Experienced**: 1-3 comprehensive case studies OR 1 or more UX design internships AND interest in mentorship

Both of the above experience levels require at least 1 case study or showcase of design work (for example, a PDF or word document).

To provide support to our less experienced members and ensure a productive environment for everyone, when recruiting we aim to have:

* around 60% of the design team be "beginners".
* at least 40% of design team (including lead) be "experienced".
