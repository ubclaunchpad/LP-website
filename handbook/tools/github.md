# GitHub

We use GitHub to host, document, and manage the code in all our projects.

That means each project has an associated GitHub repository, and documentation for the project lives in that
repository, either as version-controlled files (preferably in Markdown format
like these) or in the wiki. Projects are typically managed with
[GitHub project boards](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/)
as well.

Check out [Repository Management](./project-management/repositories.md) for guidelines on how to manage your GitHub repository and enforce coding standards.
