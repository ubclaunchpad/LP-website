# ðŸ“‹ Social Media

Launch Pad maintains a variety of social media accounts to help us reach out to students and the wider world. This page documents each account and some tips on using each.

## Contributing Content

Any Launch Pad original content could make good social media posts to help us showcase what we do! Just post it in [`#ot-sharing`](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com/archives/C01622TSU9W) to get started. You can also use this channel to request to have your Launch Pad project featured or shared!

## Accounts

You can find direct links to our accounts in the [`ubclaunchpad.com` site configuration](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/ubclaunchpad/ubclaunchpad%5C.com%24+file:config.ts+socials%28.*%3F%29%5C%7B%28.%7C%5Cn%29*%3F%7D&patternType=regexp&case=yes).

Credentials are available in the [Exec repository](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/exec) - please reach out to [`#ask-leads`](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com/archives/CK935RD3Q) to get in touch with one of the presidents if you are interested in helping us run our social media accounts!
