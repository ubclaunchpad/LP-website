# ‚è∞ Recurring Processes

This page documents administrative processes that Launch Pad runs every year. In general, both the Leadership team and the Strategy team are responsible for driving efforts on these processes.

## Selecting Leadership

This section documents how Launch Pad's leadership team is selected. Learn more about club leadership in our [manifesto's "club structure" section](/handbook/manifesto.md#club-structure).

### Co-Presidents

Each year (or whenever a co-president steps down), the existing [co-presidents](/handbook/manifesto.md#co-presidents) should nominate their replacements to the current leadership team. Unless any serious objections are raised, the nominees will act as the co-presidents of Launch Pad.

Candidates should be nominated based on active participation in Launch Pad, and understanding of our goals, and an aptitude for mentorship and team management.

There should always be two co-presidents. We should aim to have one technical and one non-technical (i.e. someone from Strategy or Design) co-president when possible.

Relevant handoff tasks are documented in the [leads onboarding guide](/handbook/onboarding/leads.md).

### Leads

Each semester, each [tech lead](/handbook/manifesto.md#project-teams) and the [design lead](/handbook/manifesto.md#design-team) should nominate members they have worked with that they believe would make good leads.

Candidates should be nominated based on active participation in Launch Pad, a robust foundation in relevant technical/design skills, and an aptitude for mentorship. Nominees should be provided with the [tech lead role description](/handbook/recruitment/tech-lead.md) or [design lead role description](/handbook/recruitment/tech-lead.md) to help them decide if they are interested in the role.

There should always be one design lead, and the number of tech leads we need should be evaluated by the leadership team based on club membership.

Relevant handoff tasks are documented in the [leads onboarding guide](/handbook/onboarding/leads.md).

## Evaluating Objectives

This section documents when and how we evaluate our club-wide objectives. Learn more about our current and past objectives in our [club objectives page](/handbook/strategy/objectives.md).

### Mid-Year Evaluation

In the middle of a school year (towards the end of the fall semester), the Strategy team should evaluate the numeric goals set out for each objective and see how we are trending towards our goal. At this point, adjustments can also be made to our objectives and goals, for example to account for shifting priorities or if a goal is deemed unfeasible.

The [club objectives page](/handbook/strategy/objectives.md) should be updated with our progress, and an announcement should be made in Slack about whether we are ahead or behind on our goals and whether the club has any feedback for the leadership team.

### End-of-Year Evaluation

At the end of a school year (towards the end of the winter semester), the Strategy team should again evaluate the numeric goals set out for each objective and see if we have achieved our goals. The leadership team should hold a retrospective meeting and determine what we did well, and what we can improve.

The [club objectives page](/handbook/strategy/objectives.md) should be updated with our progress, and improvements we could make to our processes should be updated throughout the handbook. An announcement should be made in Slack about our goals, any outcomes from the retrospective, and whether the club has any feedback for the leadership team.
