# Club Handbook

Welcome to the [UBC Launch Pad](https://ubclaunchpad.com/) handbook! Launch Pad-wide documentation is hosted in these sections - if you're not sure about something, this is the first place to check.

## üîñ Manifesto

Our [Manifesto](manifesto.md) outlines our vision and code of conduct.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools

### General Tools

See the [Tools page in Resources](../../resources/tools.md) for general tools to help you build awesome stuff!

### Slack

See the [Slack page](./tools/slack.md) to learn more about our Slack workspace!

### GitHub

We use GitHub to host, document, and manage the code in all our projects.

That means each project has an associated GitHub repository, and documentation for the project lives in that
repository, either as version-controlled files (preferably in Markdown format
like these) or in the wiki. Projects are typically managed with
[GitHub project boards](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/)
as well.

Check out [Repository Management](./repositories.md) for guidelines on how to manage your GitHub repository and enforce coding standards.

### Deployment

For general deployment advice, check out the [equivalent section in Resources](/resources/deployment.md).

Launch Pad does offer some specific advice regarding deployment - this is documented in [Deployment](./tools/deployment.md).

## üë®‚Äçüíº Project Management

These documents compile hard-won advice about the best way to run (and participate in) a Launch Pad team and build great software.

::: tip
These are guidelines, not strict rules! Teams should adjust these processes
to the way they work. Furthermore, this is a living document and should be
updated to reflect the most current and most productive development processes at
Launch Pad - in particular, open a pull request if there's something you think
should be updated or changed!

### Repository Management

Guidelines for how to manage your GitHub repository and enforce coding standards
is in [Repository Management](./project-management/repositories.md). Remember: your
repository is your main outlet to the outside world - and this outside world
includes potential employers! Make it informative, organized, and pretty!

### Sprint Planning

Guidelines for how to plan out a week's work using a Scrum-like methodology can
be found in [Sprints](./project-management/sprints.md).

### Requirements & Scope

Tips for planning out your project's overall scope are available in
[Requirements & Scope](./project-management/requirements.md).

## üè° Administration

The [Administration page](administration.md) describes the structure of UBC Launch Pad.

The [Onboarding page](onboarding.md) helps you hit the ground running once you've joined us!

## üì¶ Other Useful Repositories

There are a number of other important repositories that provide places
for documentation and discussion. Note that these are all private to
the `ubclaunchpad` GitHub organization; if you have not been added to
the org, talk to your Tech Lead or one of the Presidents.

* [Ideas](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/ideas): The goal of this repository is
  to be a place where anyone in Launch Pad can submit ideas for anything - how
  to improve Launch Pad, potential projects, event ideas... anything you want!
* [Alumni Directory](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/alumni-directory): An
  internal directory with past Launch Pad members and what they are doing now.
* [`ubclaunchpad.com`](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/ubclaunchpad.com): This
  repository houses the source code for [ubclaunchpad.com](https://ubclaunchpad.com),
  as well as documentation on how to use it (for example, to add `ubclaunchpad.com/...`
  redirect links), how to update its content (for example, to change the website's
  featured teams or update recruitment status), and how to make your own contributions!

Some useful team-specific repositories to take a look at:

* [Strategy](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/strategy): The main repo for the
  strategy team, containing sponsorship-related discussion.
* [Design](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/design): The main repo for the design
  team, containing Launch Pad graphical assets and design-related discussion.
* [Tech Leads](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/tech-leads): A repo for Tech
  Lead-specific content, such as meeting notes. Note that this repo is only
  visible to Tech Leads.
* [Exec](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/exec): Repo containing details about managing Launch Pad, such as our accounts.
