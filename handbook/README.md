## üë®‚Äçüíº Project Management <Badge type="tip" text="updated"/>

These documents compile hard-won advice about the best way to run (and participate in) a Launch Pad team and build great software. This isn't just geared towards team leads - it should be useful for everyone!

::: tip
These are **guidelines**, not strict rules! Teams should adjust these processes to the way they work. Open a pull request if there's something you think should be updated or changed!
:::

* [**Project Scope**](./project-management/scope.md): Tips for planning out your project's overall scope and getting an initial idea laid out.
* [**Sprint Planning**](./project-management/sprints.md): Guidelines and advice for how to plan out work with your team to drive forward progress on your project!
* [**Repository Management**](./project-management/repositories.md): Guidelines for how to manage your GitHub repository and enforce coding standards. Remember: your repository is your main outlet to the outside world - and this outside world includes potential employers! Make it informative, organized, and pretty!

## üè° Administration

The [Administration page](administration.md) describes the structure of UBC Launch Pad.

## üì¶ Official Repositories

There are a number of other important repositories that provide places for documentation and discussion. Note that these are all private to the `ubclaunchpad` GitHub organization; if you have not been added to the org, talk to your Tech Lead or one of the Presidents in [`#ask-leads`](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com/messages/CK935RD3Q/).

* [**Ideas**](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/ideas): The goal of this repository is
  to be a place where anyone in Launch Pad can submit ideas for anything - how
  to improve Launch Pad, potential projects, event ideas... anything you want!
* [**Alumni Directory**](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/alumni-directory): An
  internal directory with past Launch Pad members and what they are doing now.
* [**ubclaunchpad.com**](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/ubclaunchpad.com): This repository houses the source code for our website, as well as documentation on how to use it (for example, to add `ubclaunchpad.com/...` redirect links), how to update its content (for example, to change the website's featured teams or update recruitment status), and how to make your own contributions!
* [**Docs**](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/ideas): The repository that hosts the content on this website! Changes to `docs.ubclaunchpad.com` happen here.

Some teams also have dedicated repositories:

* [**Strategy**](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/strategy): The main repo for the
  strategy team, containing sponsorship-related discussion.
* [**Design**](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/design): The main repo for the design
  team, containing Launch Pad graphical assets and design-related discussion.
* [**Tech Leads**](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/tech-leads): A repo for Tech
  Lead-specific content, such as meeting notes. Note that this repo is only
  visible to Tech Leads.
* [**Exec**](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/exec): Repo containing details about managing Launch Pad, such as our accounts.

Note that links to most of these repositories are available through the handy "Quick Links" dropdown in this website's navbar!
