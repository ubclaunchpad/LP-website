# ðŸŽ‰ Onboarding for Leads

Welcome to UBC Launch Pad, and congratulations (and thank you!) for joining us as a lead!

The role of the Launch Pad leadership team is documented in our [manifesto](/handbook/manifesto.md#club-structure). The specifics of each role's responsibilities are also available in the [tech lead role description](/handbook/recruitment/tech-lead.md) and [design lead role description](/handbook/recruitment/design-lead.md).

## Checklist

### Slack Channels

Everyone should join a **private** channel named `#tm-leads-YYYY` (for example, `#tm-leads-2020`). If this channel doesn't exist yet, coordinate to get it created. This will be the primary means through which Launch Pad leadership works together. In addition, make sure you join:

* [`#ask-leads`](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com/archives/CK935RD3Q): this is where members are expected to direct questions at leadership.
* [`#ask-rocket`](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com/archives/CK93HTYQN): our Slack bot [Rocket](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/rocket2) is how teams are set up and managed - make sure you familiarize yourself with the app and ask this channel if you have questions or something is broken.
* [`#ask-design`](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com/archives/CK6D4QD8U): questions for design
* [`#ask-strategy`](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com/archives/CJVF0FQHG): questions for strategy

As a lead, you should also lead in Slack participation by example - please make sure you join any channels you find interesting and participate in them! See [our Slack guide](/handbook/tools/slack.md#finding-channels) for more details.

### Slack Status

To help people identify you, make sure you set a status in Slack indicating your role!

### GitHub Teams

Make sure you are a part of the following teams on GitHub - [Rocket](/handbook/onboarding/everyone.md#rocket-setup) should do this for you - check your email for an invitation! Please do not ask to be added directly without checking with `#ask-rocket` if there is a problem.

* [`@ubclaunchpad/leads`](https://github.com/orgs/ubclaunchpad/teams/leads), and check that you can access the [private Leads repository](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/leads) - this repository primarily contains interview resources and tracking issues
* [`@ubclaunchpad/strategy`](https://github.com/orgs/ubclaunchpad/teams/strategy), and check that you can access the [private Strategy repository](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/strategy) - this repository contains sponsorship resources and event/sponsorship tracking issues
* [`@ubclaunchpad/design`](https://github.com/orgs/ubclaunchpad/teams/design), and check that you can access the [public Design repository](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/design) - this repository contains (some) design assets, resources, and tracking issues

Additionally, the presidents should also be a part of [`@ubclaunchpad/exec`](https://github.com/orgs/ubclaunchpad/teams/exec) and familiarize themselves with the [Exec repository](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/exec), where we keep track of accounts and credentials. Permissions for this repository is managed by hand.

::: tip
Make sure that you are **watching** all relevant repositories so that you don't miss any updates! To learn more about setting up your GitHub notifications, check our [GitHub guide](../tools/github.md#setting-up-notifications).

### Google Drive

Make sure all leads are given "editor" access to the [shared Launch Pad folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u-U3w0V0MaLQrWtDdw_8n15V2lO-6gXo), which is owned by the `team@ubclaunchpad.com` account (more details are in the [Exec repository](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/exec)). [Rocket](#rocket-setup) should do this for you - check your email for an invitation! Please do not ask to be added directly without checking with `#ask-rocket` if there is a problem.

Learn more about managing these folders in the [Google Drive documentation](/handbook/tools/drive.md).

### Email and Accounts

All leads will be given access to the `strategy@ubclaunchpad.com` Gmail account to help in correspondance with partners and sponsors. Learn more about Launch Pad email in [the email documentation](/handbook/tools/email.md).

To gain access to various social media accounts, see the [social media documentation](/handbook/tools/social-media.md).

## Workflows

::: tip
We use GitHub and Slack for pretty much *everything* - make sure you are intimately familiar with **both**, regardless of your role, by reading our handcrafted guides:

* [GitHub guide](/handbook/tools/github)
* [Slack guide](/handbook/tools/slack)
:::

### Recurring Processes

The Leadership team is responsible, with the help of the Strategy team, for implementing our [recurring processes](/handbook/strategy/recurring-processes.md). This includes selecting the next generation of Launch Pad leads, working towards our club objectives, and more.

### Projects

The handbook's Project Management pages are a must-read - for all leads:

* [Scope](../project-management/scope.md) - how to develop and scope ideas for Launch Pad projects, as well as the timeline for development
* [Sprints](../project-management/sprints.md) - how to plan and collaborate with your team to deliver on your project

Additionally, technical leads will want to take a look at the [Repository Management](/handbook/project-management/repositories) page to help them set up tooling for their projects.

To set up your team, **use Rocket**, which will automatically configure GitHub teams for you. To create a team, set up a Slack channel with all your team members, then:

```
/rocket team create [TEAM] --lead [LEAD] --channel [CHANNEL]
```

### Meetings

Leads meetings between all leads (technical and non-technical) should happen on a regular basis.

TODO: flesh out what we want meetings to be like
