# ðŸŽ‰ Onboarding for Leads

Welcome to UBC Launch Pad, and congratulations (and thank you!) for joining us as a lead!

## Checklist

### Slack Channels

Everyone should join a **private** channel named `#tm-leads-YYYY` (for example, `#tm-leads-2020`). If this channel doesn't exist yet, coordinate to get it created. This will be the primary means through which Launch Pad leadership works together. In addition, make sure you join:

* [`#ask-leads`](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com/archives/CK935RD3Q): this is where members are expected to direct questions at leadership.
* [`#ask-rocket`](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com/archives/CK93HTYQN): our Slack bot [Rocket](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/rocket2) is how teams are set up and managed - make sure you familiarize yourself with the app and ask this channel if you have questions or something is broken.
* [`#ask-design`](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com/archives/CK6D4QD8U): questions for design
* [`#ask-strategy`](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com/archives/CJVF0FQHG): questions for strategy

As a lead, you should also lead in Slack participation by example - please make sure you join any channels you find interesting and participate in them! See [our Slack guide](/handbook/tools/slack.md#finding-channels) for more details.

### GitHub Teams

Make sure you are a part of the following teams on GitHub:

* [`@ubclaunchpad/leads`](https://github.com/orgs/ubclaunchpad/teams/leads), and check that you can access the [private Leads repository](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/leads) - this repository primarily contains interview resources and tracking issues
* [`@ubclaunchpad/strategy`](https://github.com/orgs/ubclaunchpad/teams/strategy), and check that you can access the [private Strategy repository](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/strategy) - this repository contains sponsorship resources and event/sponsorship tracking issues
* [`@ubclaunchpad/design`](https://github.com/orgs/ubclaunchpad/teams/design), and check that you can access the [public Design repository](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/design) - this repository contains (some) design assets, resources, and tracking issues

Additionally, the presidents should also be a part of [`@ubclaunchpad/exec`](https://github.com/orgs/ubclaunchpad/teams/exec) and familiarize themselves with the [Exec repository](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/exec), where we keep track of accounts and credentials.

::: tip
Make sure that you are **watching** all relevant repositories so that you don't miss any updates! To learn more about setting up your GitHub notifications, check our [GitHub guide](../tools/github.md#setting-up-notifications).

### Google Drive

Make sure all leads are given "editor" access to the [shared Launch Pad folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u-U3w0V0MaLQrWtDdw_8n15V2lO-6gXo), which is owned by the `team@ubclaunchpad.com` account (more details are in the [Exec repository](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/exec)).

Within the shared Launch Pad folder, try to maintain the following structure:

* [Projects](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/18piFDBdAUuZAOf9xOgpf2_HBUuVNae0S) - folders for project teams
  * Note that everyone should be granted access to this folder (part of [Onboarding for Everyone](../onboarding/everyone.md))
  * Each tech lead should create a folder for their project inside a year subfolder ("Projects YYYY") of this folder
  * Inside each project folder, each lead should create a document for meeting notes. All their project meetings should go in this document. See [Sprint Planning](../project-management/sprints.md) for more details.
* [Strategy](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0BwdNv1PZjDeXMkc1eDVNY1ZHT00) - see [Onboarding for Strategy](./strategy.md)
* [Design](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Zfe25r3D77hGdyMkj0tlxHNa-r7fAq1d) - see [Onboarding for Design](./design.md)
* [Leads](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1hgPcUC_DrFMmzZ04pBSlZFig4v9AbTuv) - that's for us!
  * Leads should create a document for meeting notes titled "Leads: Meeting Notes YYYY". All leads meetings should go in this document.
* [Exec](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/10b_2H5EhPpJtdgNi7QizRhWC9Qtivr8L) - for the presidents
  * Presidents should create a document for meeting notes titled "Exec: Meeting Notes YYYY". All exec meetings should go in this document.

::: warning
In general, assume pretty liberal with access to folders in Google Drive (since it is hard to keep track of access over time, especially for individual documents, and for ease of use we generally share entire folders with everyone).

Sensitive information (such as contact details for sponsors) should be tracked in one of our [private GitHub repositories](#github-teams) and distributed as required (for example, by linking to specific issues from Drive documents).

Similarly, **do not add credentials (usernames, passwords) in Google Drive**. Instead, get them added to the private [Exec repository](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/exec/blob/master/assets.md) and provide the credentials to those who need it as required.

## Workflows

::: tip
We use GitHub and Slack for pretty much *everything* - make sure you are intimately familiar with **both**, regardless of your role, by reading our handcrafted guides:

* [GitHub guide](/handbook/tools/github)
* [Slack guide](/handbook/tools/slack)
:::

### Projects

The handbook's Project Management pages are a must-read - for all leads:

* [Scope](../project-management/scope.md) - how to develop and scope ideas for Launch Pad projects, as well as the timeline for development
* [Sprints](../project-management/sprints.md) - how to plan and collaborate with your team to deliver on your project

Additionally, technical leads will want to take a look at the [Repository Management](/handbook/project-management/repositories) page to help them set up tooling for their projects.

### Meetings

Leads meetings between all leads (technical and non-technical) should happen on a regular basis.

TODO: flesh out what we want meetings to be like
