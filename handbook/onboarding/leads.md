# ðŸš€ Onboarding for Leads

Welcome to UBC Launch Pad, and congratulations (and thank you!) for joining us as a lead!

## Checklist

### Slack Channels

Everyone should join a **private** channel named `#tm-leads-YYYY` (for example, `#tm-leads-2020`). If this channel doesn't exist yet, coordinate to get it created. This will be the primary means through which Launch Pad leadership works together. In addition, make sure you join:

* [`#ask-leads`](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com/archives/CK935RD3Q): this is where members are expected to direct questions at leadership.
* [`#ask-rocket`](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com/archives/CK93HTYQN): our Slack bot [Rocket](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/rocket2) is how teams are set up and managed - make sure you familiarize yourself with the app and ask this channel if you have questions or something is broken.
* [`#ask-design`](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com/archives/CK6D4QD8U): questions for design
* [`#ask-strategy`](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com/archives/CJVF0FQHG): questions for strategy

As a lead, you should also lead in Slack participation by example - please make sure you join any channels you find interesting and participate in them! See [our Slack guide](/handbook/tools/slack.md#finding-channels) for more details.

### GitHub Teams

Make sure you are a part of:

* [`@ubclaunchpad/leads`](https://github.com/orgs/ubclaunchpad/teams/leads), and check that you can access the [Leads repository](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/leads)
* [`@ubclaunchpad/strategy`](https://github.com/orgs/ubclaunchpad/teams/strategy), and check that you can access the [Strategy repository](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/strategy)
* [`@ubclaunchpad/design`](https://github.com/orgs/ubclaunchpad/teams/design), and check that you can access the [Design repository](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/design)

Additional, the president(s) should also be a part of [`@ubclaunchpad/exec`](https://github.com/orgs/ubclaunchpad/teams/exec) and familiarize themselves with the [Exec repository](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/exec), where we keep track of accounts and credentials.

::: tip
Make sure that you are **watching** all relevant repositories so that you don't miss any updates! To learn more about setting up your GitHub notifcations, check our [GitHub guide](../tools/github.md#setting-up-notifications).

### Google Drive

Make sure all leads are given "editor" access to the [shared Launch Pad folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u-U3w0V0MaLQrWtDdw_8n15V2lO-6gXo), which is owned by the `team@ubclaunchpad.com` account (more details are in the [Exec repository](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/exec)).
