# ðŸš€ Onboarding for Leads

Welcome to UBC Launch Pad, and congratulations (and thank you!) for joining us as a lead!

## Checklist

### Slack Channels

Everyone should join a **private** channel named `#tm-leads-YYYY` (for example, `#tm-leads-2020`). If this channel doesn't exist yet, coordinate to get it created. THis will be the primary means through which Launch Pad leadership coordinates work. In addition, make sure you join:

* [`#ask-leads`](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com/archives/CK935RD3Q): this is where members are expected to direct questions at leadership.
* [`#ask-rocket`](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com/archives/CK93HTYQN): [Rocket](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/rocket2) is how teams are set up and managed - make sure you familiarize yourself with the app and ask this channel if you have questions or something is broken.
* [`#ask-design`](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com/archives/CK6D4QD8U)
* [`#ask-strategy`](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com/archives/CJVF0FQHG)

As a lead, you should also lead in Slack participation by example - please make sure you join any channels you find interesting and participate in them! See [our Slack guide](/handbook/tools/slack.md#finding-channels) for more details.
