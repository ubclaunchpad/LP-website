## Checklist

### Slack Channels

Make sure you are added to:

* [`#tm-design`](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com/archives/CNV9XR2SU): private team channel.
* [`#ask-design`](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com/archives/CK0H2GNQH): this is where members are expected to direct questions at design.

See [our Slack guide](/handbook/tools/slack.md) for more details.

### GitHub Teams

Designers should have a presence in GitHub to know what is going on between product teams. First step would be to [make a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you don't have one!

Second, Make sure you are a part of the GitHub team [`@ubclaunchpad/design`](https://github.com/orgs/ubclaunchpad/teams/design), and check that you have access to the [Design repository](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/design) - this repository contains (some) design assets, resources, and tracking issues.

Third, make sure that you are added into your team's Github repository by your team's tech lead. 

Last, familiarize yourself with Github and how it works. We will be using Github for most of our product management and asset sharing. (This is where we should consolidate all assets & asset links) You don't need to become a pro right away, most of your Github use will be with issues and pull requests. Check how those work here: [Github guide](../tools/github.md)

::: tip
Make sure that you are **watching** all relevant repositories so that you don't miss any updates! To learn more about setting up your GitHub notifcations, check our [GitHub guide](../tools/github.md#setting-up-notifications).

### Google Drive

Make sure all designers are given "editor" access to the [shared Launch Pad Design subfolder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Zfe25r3D77hGdyMkj0tlxHNa-r7fAq1d), which is owned by the `team@ubclaunchpad.com` account.

Also, if your team decides to use google drive, make sure you are added to that by your project lead. Also make sure that you are linking your gdrive assets to your Github repository for easy accessibility.

### Figma

Make sure that you have a Figma account which you can create here: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). It's completely free to use, web based and its the best collaborative design tool out there!
* You can also download the Figma app on your desktop here: [Download Link](https://www.figma.com/downloads/)

Other alternatives available out there are Adobe XD and Sketch. If you plan to use any of those tools, it is recommended that you import your designs into Figma so that you can share your prototypes and wireframe files with your developers.

## Workflows

The Agile Method is the workflow that teams in LaunchPad usually follow. It is important that you familiarize youself with this type of workflow especially working in cross-functional product teams. 

During the whole cycle, you will have to make sure that all your assets are constantly being uploaded into Github. (or gdrive links can be found in your project's Github repository)

::: tip
We use GitHub and Slack for pretty much *everything* - make sure you are intimately familiar with **both**, regardless of your role, by reading our handcrafted guides:

* [GitHub guide](https://docs.ubclaunchpad.com/handbook/tools/github)
* [Slack guide](https://docs.ubclaunchpad.com/handbook/tools/slack)
