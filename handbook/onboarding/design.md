Make sure you are added to:

* [`#tm-design`](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com/archives/CNV9XR2SU): private team channel.
* [`#ask-design`](https://ubclaunchpad.slack.com/archives/CK0H2GNQH): this is where members are expected to direct questions at design.

See [our Slack guide](/handbook/tools/slack.md) for more details.

### GitHub Teams

Make sure you are a part of the GitHub team [`@ubclaunchpad/design`](https://github.com/orgs/ubclaunchpad/teams/design), and check that you have access to the [Design repository](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/design).

::: tip
Make sure that you are **watching** all relevant repositories so that you don't miss any updates! To learn more about setting up your GitHub notifcations, check our [GitHub guide](../tools/github.md#setting-up-notifications).

### Google Drive

Make sure all designers are given "editor" access to the [shared Launch Pad Design subfolder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Zfe25r3D77hGdyMkj0tlxHNa-r7fAq1d), which is owned by the `team@ubclaunchpad.com` account.

## Workflows

::: tip
We use GitHub and Slack for pretty much *everything* - make sure you are intimately familiar with **both**, regardless of your role, by reading our handcrafted guides:

* [GitHub guide](https://docs.ubclaunchpad.com/handbook/tools/github)
* [Slack guide](https://docs.ubclaunchpad.com/handbook/tools/slack)

TODO: how the Design team will use handbook / GitHub / Drive / Figma etc.
