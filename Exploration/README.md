## Distributed Systems

* The [Systems Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
  is a great big repo full of goodness that covers everything from
  "what is a load balancer?" to "what kind of database should I use?" It
  links to lots of real-world examples (mostly on company blogs) and also provides
  a set of Anki flashcards (in case you're studying for an exam 😅).

## Operating Systems

* [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
  is a free online textbook that introduces basic operating system concepts like
  processes, virtual memory, and file systems in an accessible, highly-readable way.

## Programming Languages

* [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com)
  is a (sadly unfinished) book-length tutorial on building your own interpreter,
  from the ground up (including every single line of code!). The
  [Durian](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/durian) team made a lot of use of it!

## Machine Learning

* [Neural Networks and Machine Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com)
  is an overview of (deep) neural networks, one of the most popular techniques
  for machine learning. It's written by Michael Nielsen, also known for one
  of the standard quantum computing textbooks.

## Coding Challenge Practice

* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) is probably the most popular website for coding
  challenges and comes highly recommended for interview preparation - big companies
  often take interview questions directly from LeetCode!
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) is a similar coding challenge site,
  which many companies use directly for interview screening.
* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a very different style of coding
  challenge site - it has a much sparser presentation than rivals like LeetCode
  and HackerRank, and generally focuses on (sometimes rather esoteric) mathematical
  conundrums. But for the mathmatically-inclined programmer, it can be a rich
  resource for delightful insights. Also, our very own ML Tech Lead Kevin built
  a [command line tool](https://github.com/iKevinY/EulerPy) to make it easier
  to work on Project Euler problems in Python!
