# üîç Project Scope

This document outlines advice on how to manage projects requirements and scope.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

A project's scope should be **as minimal as possible** while maintaining core
functionality. The scope should be defined in terms of must-have features
("requirements") and bonus features ("stretch goals"). As much as possible, a
project's set of requirements should fully describe the necessary steps to
building the project.

Every project should have a complete scope, with each requirement described in
a README or Wiki and as Epics on ZenHub, before development begins.

## Managing Risk

Some requirements may be technically difficult to build, rely on a third-party
API, or involve risk in some other way. In general, at the beginning of a
project, there may be some unknown factors that a project's success depends on.

These risks should be identified as soon as possible and documented. Once risks
are documented, they should be resolved as soon possible. For example:

* if a feature is challenging to implement, get a prototype working.
* if you have a dependency on a third-party data source, contact or research the
  third party and verify the data is available, adequately formatted, etc.
